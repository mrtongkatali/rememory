# Rememory

A "simple" [memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) (for now) built using ReactJS. At the moment, it doesn't include any backend services. Instead, I'm using [FakerJS](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate the data for me. 

This project is currently in development and Iâ€™m working on it during my free time only. Iâ€™m excited to see how it evolves and progresses. ðŸ¤ž
